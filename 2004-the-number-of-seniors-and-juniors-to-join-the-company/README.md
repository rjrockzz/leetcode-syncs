<pre><strong>Input:</strong> 
Candidates table:
+-------------+------------+--------+
| employee_id | experience | salary |
+-------------+------------+--------+
| 1           | Junior     | 10000  |
| 9           | Junior     | 10000  |
| 2           | Senior     | 20000  |
| 11          | Senior     | 20000  |
| 13          | Senior     | 50000  |
| 4           | Junior     | 40000  |
+-------------+------------+--------+
<strong>Output:</strong> 
+------------+---------------------+
| experience | accepted_candidates |
+------------+---------------------+
| Senior     | 2                   |
| Junior     | 2                   |
+------------+---------------------+
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
We can hire 2 seniors with IDs (2, 11). Since the budget is $70000 and the sum of their salaries is $40000, we still have $30000 but they are not enough to hire the senior candidate with ID 13.
We can hire 2 juniors with IDs (1, 9). Since the remaining budget is $30000 and the sum of their salaries is $20000, we still have $10000 but they are not enough to hire the junior candidate with ID 4.

We cannot hire any seniors with the current budget as we need at least $80000 to hire one senior.
